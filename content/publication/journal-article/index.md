abstract: The technology-driven application of big data is expected to assist policymaking towards sustainable development\; however, the relevant literature has not addressed human welfare under climate change, which limits the understanding of climate change impacts on human societies. We present the first application of unique mobile phone network data to evaluate the current nation-wide human welfare of coastal tourism at Japanese beaches and project the value change using the four climate change scenarios. The results show that the projected national economic value loss rates are more significant than the projected national physical beach loss rates. Our findings demonstrate regional differences in recreational values\:\ most southern beaches with larger current values would disappear, while the current small values of the northern beaches would remain. These changes imply that the ranks of the beaches, based on economic values, would enable policymakers to discuss management priorities under climate change.

summary: 1) Big data application is an emerging field in tourism. 2) Mobile phone network data reveals coastal tourism value across Japan. 3) The approach projects spatial-seasonal gradients of the values under climate change. 4) Changes in beach ranks based on the values enable to discuss policy priorities. 5) This unique approach applies to a wide variety of climate-vulnerable services.
